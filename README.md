# fintech-test-task-repo

Application developed using a Copilot AI for autocorrection and structuring the code. This app is built using classic MVC architecture as a good choice for small, one-page, but scalable application with unknown feature expansion. UI AutoLayout was made also by Copilot AI with changes according to request and good UI/UX practices and bug fixes. No external libraries are used since the app is small scale, but Alamofire should be used when API will grow. Alamofire will be implemented and integrated easily via Copilot AI when needed.

To Run the app, you should checkout or download the source code project in the newest Xcode version and just execute Run, using your own personal team for simulator, or shared Apple ID with Xcode and iPhone for physical device. Application is tested by myself and one external tester. Please note that application is developed for the newest iOS 18 version but minimal supported as Xcode recommends is iOS 15.

Have a great day!
